# Test Authentication endpoint
#
# "-p" instructs "ab" to send a post request. Normally, the file passed would contain URL encoded data, but
# for this application, the endpoint doesn't accept any data other than the "Authorization" header.
ab -A '<username>:<password>' -p <empty_file> -n <total_requests> -c <total_concurrent_requests> 'http://localhost:<port>/irods-http/0.9.5/authenticate'

# To test other things, get a bearer token by running the following first.
bearer_token=$(curl -s -X POST --user '<username>:<password>' 'http://localhost:<port>/irods-http/0.9.5/authenticate')

# Stat'ing a collection.
ab -n <total_requests> -c <total_concurrent_requests> -H "Authorization: Bearer $bearer_token" 'http://localhost:<port>/irods-http/0.9.5/collections?op=stat&lpath=/tempZone/home/<username>'

# Stat'ing a resource.
ab -n <total_requests> -c <total_concurrent_requests> -H "Authorization: Bearer $bearer_token" 'http://localhost:<port>/irods-http/0.9.5/resources?op=stat&name=demoResc'

# Reading bytes in a data object.
