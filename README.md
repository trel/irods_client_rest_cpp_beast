# iRODS HTTP API

A project that presents an iRODS Zone as HTTP v1.1.

## Quickstart (Running from Docker Hub Image)

Generate a local configuration JSON file.

```
docker run --rm irods/irods_http_api --dump-config-template > config.json
```

Edit/update the template `config.json` file (point to your iRODS Zone, remove OIDC and TLS sections, etc.).

```
vim config.json
```

Launch the HTTP API with your customized configuration file to check for success/errors.

```
docker run --rm --name irods_http_api \
    -v ./config.json:/config.json:ro \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    irods/irods_http_api
```

Then, the HTTP API will be available.

```
$ curl -X POST -u rods:rods \
 http://localhost:9000/irods-http-api/0.2.0/authenticate
568bbfc2-7d19-4723-b659-bb9325f9b076

$ curl -s http://localhost:9000/irods-http-api/0.2.0/collections \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer 568bbfc2-7d19-4723-b659-bb9325f9b076' \
    --data-urlencode 'op=stat' \
    --data-urlencode 'lpath=/tempZone/home/rods' -G | jq

## Documentation

API documentation can be found in [API.md](./API.md).

## Build Dependencies

- iRODS development package
- iRODS externals package for boost
- iRODS externals package for nlohmann-json
- iRODS externals package for spdlog 
- Curl development package
- OpenSSL development package
- GenQuery2 package (optional)

## Build

This project can be built with or without support for [GenQuery2](https://github.com/irods/irods_api_plugin_genquery2).

GenQuery2 is disabled by default.

### Building without GenQuery2

If you don't need support for GenQuery2, follow the normal CMake steps.

```bash
mkdir build # Preferably outside of the repository
cd build
cmake /path/to/repository
make package # Use -j to use more parallelism.
```

Upon success, you should have an installable package.

### Building with GenQuery2

To build with GenQuery2 enabled, the HTTP API needs access to files only provided by the GenQuery2 package.

If you haven't already done so, install the GenQuery2 package. See the [GenQuery2](https://github.com/irods/irods_api_plugin_genquery2) repository for details on how to do that.

Now, run the following steps to produce an installable package.

```bash
mkdir build # Preferably outside of the repository
cd build
cmake -DIRODS_ENABLE_GENQUERY2=YES /path/to/repository
make package # Use -j to use more parallelism.
```

Keep in mind that even though you've compiled the HTTP API with support for GenQuery2, that is half the story. You must also install the GenQuery2 package on the iRODS server which the HTTP API will connect to and the iRODS Catalog Service Provider.

## Docker

This project provides two Dockerfiles, one for building and one for running the application. GenQuery2 is enabled by default. As mentioned in the previous section, the iRODS server must have GenQuery2 installed before attempting to use the parser.

**IMPORTANT: All commands in the sections that follow assume you are located in the root of the repository.**

### The Builder Image

The builder image is responsible for building the iRODS HTTP API package. Before you can use it, you must build the image. To do that, run the following:
```bash
docker build -t irods-http-api-builder -f irods_builder.Dockerfile .
```

With the builder image in hand, all that's left is to get the source code for the GenQuery2 project and HTTP API project. The builder image is designed to compile code sitting on your machine. This is important because it gives you the ability to build any fork or branch of the projects.

Building the packages requires mounting the projects into the container at the appropriate locations. The command you run should look similar to the one below. Don't forget to create the directory which will hold your packages!
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -v /path/to/irods_api_plugin_genquery2:/genquery2_source:ro \
    -v /path/to/irods_client_http_api:/http_api_source:ro \
    -v /path/to/packages_directory:/packages_output \
    irods-http-api-builder
```

If everything succeeds, you will have two DEB packages in the local directory you mapped to **/packages_output**.

### The Runner Image

The runner image is responsible for running the iRODS HTTP API. Building the runner image requires the DEB packages for GenQuery2 and the iRODS HTTP API to exist on the local machine. See the previous section for details on generating the packages.

To build the image, run the following command:
```bash
docker build -t irods-http-api-runner \
    -f irods_runner.Dockerfile \
    /path/to/packages/directory
```

If all goes well, you will have a containerized iRODS HTTP API server! You can verify this by checking the version information. Below is an example.
```bash
$ docker run -it --rm irods-http-api-runner -v
irods_http_api v0.2.0-<build_sha>
```

### Launching the Container

To run the containerized server, you need to provide a configuration file at the correct location. If you do not have a configuration file already, see [Configuration](#configuration) for details.

To launch the server, run the following command:
```bash
docker run -d --rm --name irods_http_api \
    -v /path/to/config/file:/config.json:ro \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    irods-http-api-runner
```

The first thing the server will do is validate the configuration. If the configuration fails validation, the server will exit immediately. If the configuration passes validation, then congratulations, you now have a working iRODS HTTP API server!

You can view the log output using `docker logs -f` or by passing `-it` to `docker run` instead of `-d`.

If for some reason the default schema file is not sufficient, you can instruct the iRODS HTTP API to use a different schema file. See the following example.
```bash
# Generate the default JSON schema.
docker run -it --rm irods-http-api-runner --dump-default-jsonschema > schema.json

# Tweak the schema.
vim schema.json

# Launch the server with the new schema file.
docker run -d --rm --name irods_http_api \
    -v /path/to/config/file:/config.json:ro \
    -v ./schema.json:/jsonschema.json:ro \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    irods-http-api-runner \
    --jsonschema-file /jsonschema.json
```

### Stopping the Container

If the container was launched with `-it`, use **CTRL-C** or `docker container stop <container_name>` to shut it down.

If the container was launched with `-d`, use `docker container stop <container_name>`.

## Configuration

Before you can run the server, you'll need to create a configuration file.

You can generate a configuration file by running the following:
```bash
irods_http_api --dump-config-template > config.json
```

**IMPORTANT: `--dump-config-template` does not produce a fully working configuration. It must be updated before it can be used.**

### Configuration File Structure

The JSON structure below represents the default configuration.

Notice how some of the configuration values are wrapped in angle brackets (e.g. `"<string>"`). These are placeholder values that must be updated before launch.

**IMPORTANT: The comments in the JSON structure are there for explanatory purposes and must not be included in your configuration. Failing to follow this requirement will result in the server failing to start up.**

## Run

To run the server, do the following:
```bash
irods_http_api /path/to/config.json
```

To stop the server, you can use **CTRL-C** or send **SIGINT** or **SIGTERM** to the process.

## OpenID Connect

Some additional configuration is required to run the OpenID Connect portion of the HTTP API.
Following are a few points of interest.

### OpenID Provider Requirements and HTTP API Configuration

The OpenID Provider, at this moment, must support discovery via a well-known endpoint.
The URL to the OpenID Provider must be specified in the `provider_url` OIDC configuration parameter.

One should take care to ensure that `/.well-known/openid-configuration` is not included
in the configuration parameter, as this is included automatically.

The OpenID Provider must be running prior to starting the HTTP API server, otherwise, the HTTP API server
will not be able to query the required information from the desired OpenID Provider.

Additionally, the OIDC `redirect_uri` parameter must be set to the HTTP API's authentication endpoint.
This is required, as the Authorization Code Grant needs to be redirected back to the HTTP API, to complete
HTTP API token generation.

### Add your specified `irods_user_claim` to the user's claims

Currently, the server looks for the custom claim in the ID Token, which is specified in the `irods_user_claim` parameter.
This serves as the mapping mechanism for an OIDC User to an iRODS User.

A user who authenticates but does not have the claim specified in `irods_user_claim` mapped in their account
will not have access to the API. A HTTP 400 Bad Request status code will be returned if the claim specified in `irods_user_claim` is not found.

### Supported Grants

Currently, the HTTP API server supports the following two grants:

- Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
- Authorization Code Grant

While we also currently support the _Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant_, there are plans to remove
support for this in the future.

Reason being, the [OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics) draft,
as well as the the [OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1/) draft both deprecate that grant.
More information can be found on the reasoning for the deprecation in the links provided above.
